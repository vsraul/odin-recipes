        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>12 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet, cook and stir ground beef until brown. Add onions and garlic, and cook until onions are transparent. Stir in tomato sauce and tomato paste. Season with salt and oregano. Simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining salt, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
